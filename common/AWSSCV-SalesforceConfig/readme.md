# Salesforce Config
Establishes a Self-Signed SSL Certificate, Salesforce Connected App, a Salesforce User, and information about the Salesforce org. Saves the information to the AWS account using AWS Secrets Manager for secure storage and retrieval of the credentials and configuration info as needed. Also creates an IAM Policy and Role common to the deployents from this repository.

# Setup
Follow the following steps to prepare your Salesforce Org before running the CloudFormation template. As you proceed through these instructions, it is reccomended that you use a text editor to save important information along the way. Each item you need to save will be specifically called out. Much of this process is based on the [Create Your Connected App](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/sfdx_travis_ci/sfdx_travis_ci_connected_app) Trailhead.

## Prerequisite
You will need OpenSSL to generate certificates. An easy way to checlk if you already have OpenSSL is to open a command line/terminal window and type `which ssl`. You should see a response similar to `/usr/bin/openssl`. If you do not, you will need to install OpenSSL before continuing.

## Create a self-signed SSL certificate and private key
1. Create a certificates folder on your computer to store the files that will be created.
2. Open a command line/terminal window and navigate to your newly created folder
3. Generate an RSA private key by entering `openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:SomePassword -out server.pass.key 2048`
 - NOTE: Make sure to replace **SomePassword** with a password of your choosing
4. Now use the private key to generate a key file by entering `openssl rsa -passin pass:SomePassword -in server.pass.key -out server.key`
 - NOTE: Make sure to replace **SomePassword** with the password that you provided above
5. Delete the server.pass.key file by entering `rm server.pass.key`
6. Next, you will request the certificate. Once you enter the following command, you will be asked to provide additional information. Please keep track of what you have provided. To request the certificate, enter `openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr`
7. Now, you need to generate the SSL certificate. Enter `openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt`
8. Fianlly, you need to encode the private key for storage by entering `base64 server.key > encoded_key.txt`
8. Your folder should now have four files: 
 - server.crt <- This is your certificate
 - server.csr <- This is the certificate request
 - server.key <- This is the private key
 - encoded_key.txt <- This is the base64 encoded private key

## Store Salesforce Settings in AWS Secrets Manager
To ensure that your Salesforce credentials are secure, the Lambdas require that the credentials are stored in AWS Secrets Manager. AWS Secrets Manager is a highly secure service that helps you store and retrieve secrets.

1.	Right-click/control-click to download the [CloudFormation template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-salesforce-scv/master/common/AWSSCV-SalesforceAccessSecrets/CloudFormation/awsscv-ssm.yaml).
2. In a new browser tab, login to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home)
