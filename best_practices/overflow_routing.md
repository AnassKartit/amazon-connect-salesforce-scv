# Managing increases in call volumes with routing profiles
All contact centers need to deal with fluctuations in call volumes. Depending on the overall customer strategy, any number of measures can be put into place to reduce call spikes or to deflect them using various methods. Depending on configuration or scenario, some of the more common deflection methods include:
* **Providing access to an FAQ:** Either via voice menu or redirecting to a website, adding the option to find answers to frequently asked questions can reduce the overall call volume that reaches your agents. Deflection to a web-based FAQ is tyrpically preferred as it will reduce the load on the telephony infrastructure. 
* **Providing robust self-service options:** Finding ways for customers to self serve allows for reduction in call volume that reaches queues while also providing for good customer experiences. 
* **Offer callbacks:** Providing the customer with the option to be called back when it is their turn is great for customer experience, but it doesn't necessarily reduce the queue load since the calls are still technically in the queue. It does also offer cost savings in Amazon Connect/Service Cloud Voice as telephony charges and platform minutes are not consumed while a callback is queueud.
