# Salesforce Config
Establishes a Self-Signed SSL Certificate, Salesforce Connected App, a Salesforce User, and information about the Salesforce org. Saves the information to the AWS account using AWS Secrets Manager for secure storage and retrieval of the credentials and configuration info as needed. Also creates an IAM Policy and Role common to the deployents from this repository.

# Setup
Follow the following steps to prepare your Salesforce Org before running the CloudFormation template. As you proceed through these instructions, it is recommended that you use a text editor to save important information along the way. Each item you need to save will be specifically called out. Much of this process is based on the [Create Your Connected App](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/sfdx_travis_ci/sfdx_travis_ci_connected_app) Trailhead, but the instructions here should be used in place of those from the Trailhead.

## Prerequisites
1. Complete the [AWSSCV Common Layers](../../Common/AWSSCV-CommonLayers/readme.md) Setup
2. You will need OpenSSL to generate certificates. An easy way to check if you already have OpenSSL is to open a command line/terminal window and type `which ssl`. You should see a response similar to `/usr/bin/openssl`. If you do not, you will need to install OpenSSL before continuing.

## Create a self-signed SSL certificate and private key
1. Create a certificates folder on your computer to store the files that will be created.
2. Open a command line/terminal window and navigate to your newly created folder
3. Generate an RSA private key by entering `openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:SomePassword -out server.pass.key 2048`
 - NOTE: Make sure to replace **SomePassword** with a password of your choosing
4. Now use the private key to generate a key file by entering `openssl rsa -passin pass:SomePassword -in server.pass.key -out server.key`
 - NOTE: Make sure to replace **SomePassword** with the password that you provided above
5. Delete the server.pass.key file by entering `rm server.pass.key`
6. Next, you will request the certificate. Once you enter the following command, you will be asked to provide additional information. Please keep track of what you have provided. To request the certificate, enter `openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr`
7. Now, you need to generate the SSL certificate. Enter `openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt`
8. Fianlly, you need to encode the private key for storage by entering `base64 server.key > encoded_key.txt`
8. Your folder should now have four files: 
 - server.crt <- This is your certificate
 - server.csr <- This is the certificate request
 - server.key <- This is the private key
 - encoded_key.txt <- This is the base64 encoded private key

## Store Salesforce Settings in AWS Secrets Manager
To ensure that your Salesforce credentials are secure, the Lambdas require that the credentials are stored in AWS Secrets Manager. AWS Secrets Manager is a highly secure service that helps you store and retrieve secrets.

1.	Right-click/control-click to download the [CloudFormation template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-salesforce-scv/master/Common/AWSSCV-SalesforceConfig/CloudFormation/awsscv-ssm.yaml).
2. In a new browser tab, login to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home)
3.	Make sure you are in the same region as your Amazon Connect instance. You can set the region by expanding the region selector in the upper right and choosing the region
4.	Navigate to the CloudFormation console
5.	Select Create Stack, and choose With new resources (standard)
6.	In the Specify Template section, choose Upload a template file
7.	Select Choose file
8.	Navigate to the folder where you saved awsscv-ssm.yaml
9.	Select Next
10.	In the Stack Name field, enter `AWSSCV-SalesforceConfig`
11.	Enter the parameters as follows (most from your notepad):
 - AWSRegion: Select the region that you have deployed Amazon Connect in
 - ConnectInstanceName: Your connect instance name
 - AWSSalesforceCommonPythonLayer: The ARN of the Common Python Layer created by deployment of the AWSSCV-CommonLayers prerequisite stack. This value is available in the outputs of the AWSSCV-CommonLayers stack.
 - sfConsumerKey: The consumer key from your connected app
 - sfHost: The full https url to your salesforce org
 - sfOrgId: Provide your Salesforce.com Organization ID
 - sfPrivateKey: The contents of the encoded_key.txt that you generated as a part of the setup process.
 - sfUsername: Your awsutil username
 - sfMode: The type of Salesforce org (PROD, DEV, SANDBOX)
12.	Select Next
13.	In Service Cloud Voice deployments, it is normal to see a warning on the next page, Configure stack options
14.	Scroll to the bottom and select Next
15.	Scroll to the bottom and select Create Stack
16.	After a minute or two, the stack should complete.

## Post Install Validation
Once the Salesforce Config CloudFormation stack is complete, the Salesforce integration should be validated.

1. While in the Stack details, select **Resources**
2. Find the Lambda function with the Logical ID **scvsalesforcevalidator**
3. **Select the link** in the Physical ID column to open that resource in a new tab and switch to that tab.
4. Select the **Test** button
5. Provide an **Event name**
6. You may keep the default test payload
7. Select the **Create** button
8. Select the **Test** button
